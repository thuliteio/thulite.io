As we look ahead to 2026, Thulite is evolving to better serve creators and teams. This update is all about simplifying the experience, focusing on what matters most, and setting a clear direction for the future of the platform.

## Simplicity

Thulite 2026 marks a return to basics, focusing on clarity and simplicity.

## User Experience

The new user experience is inspired by Norrsken by Anders Norén, offering a streamlined and modern interface.

## Thulite CLI

The [Thulite CLI](/blog/thulite-cli-2-0/) becomes the primary tool, making it easier than ever to manage your projects.

## Templates

[Templates](http://localhost:1313/templates/)—both starters and themes—are now the foundation for getting started quickly.

## Focus

We've discontinued both paid themes (like Vermeer and Norrsken) and community themes (such as Simply Cyan), as well as the options to submit new themes or integrations. [Doks](https://getdoks.org/) remains the main theme for product sites, ensuring a consistent and robust experience.

## Doks

Starting in 2026, Doks will continue to be fully open source and free to use, but we'll introduce optional paid plans for teams that want more convenience and guarantees. The core Doks framework remains unchanged, while paid plans focus on curated updates, priority support, and Anna — a fully configured CMS setup for Doks that streamlines content editing and maintenance. This approach allows us to fund long-term development while keeping Doks community-friendly and accessible to everyone.

## Thanks

Thank you for being part of the Thulite journey. Your feedback and support drive our progress and inspire us to keep improving. We're excited for what's ahead and look forward to building the future of Thulite together.
